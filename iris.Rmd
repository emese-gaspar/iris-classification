## About the data

Because I am still getting used to integrating R with GitHub, I decided to start with a fairly basic project. I am using a dataset built into R called `iris`. Here is what the R documentation contains about Edgar Anderson's Iris Data:

> *This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.*

```{r cars}
head(iris)
```

###**Checking for missing values:**

```{r}
summary(iris)
if(any(is.na(iris)) == FALSE){
  print("There are no missing values.")}
  else{}
    print("There are missing values.")}
```
